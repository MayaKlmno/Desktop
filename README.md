Here are some of my personal Projects. These projects are ones for which I created on my own time. 
The first project is in the file: test 01 --> In this file contains the code which I wrote in the summer of 2024 my Stair light project. 
                                This project: Uses two motion sensors, LEDs, and a raspberry pi. What happens is when one of the motion sensors is triggered, the LEDs 
                                turn on, starting from the where the motion sensor is (one end of the stairs) all the way to the other motion sensor is (the other end of the stairs).
                                Then turns off starting from where it turned on initialy. The same thing happens if the sensor is triggered from the top of the stairs, just the other way.
